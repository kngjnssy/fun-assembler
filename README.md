## About the project

*This is essentially just the binary converter part of the Hack Assembler based on the nand2tetris course.*

### How to run

clone and type:

- "python3 assembler.py test/Add.asm" - to run the basic version.
- "python3 fun_assembler.py test/Add.asm" - to run the (not entirely pure) functional approach.
- "python3 shorter_fun.py test/Add.asm" - for the (not entirely pure) even shorter (via composing functions) approach.

the output binary files can be found in the test folder with .hack extension

### TODO adding the rest of the translation capabilities in a functional fashion.

*(for the fully functioning HackAssembler, type "python3 HackAssembler.py" + any of the .asm files from any folders provided)*
